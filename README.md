### MINI-PROJECT: ARKANOID GAME (SORT OF LIKE JARDIANAINS, WITHOUT NAINS AND POWERUPS!)

I've added **directional movement whwn the ball hits the paddle** and **sound effects**, including a **master sound control**!!
Also more levels are added, and can be altered by changing only a single variable. By default I've set it at 2. Also there is feature of "lives", by default which is also set at 2 by me, but can be changed from a single variable of "js/game.js". 
**Lives are displayed using heart icon, whereas current level is denoted by golf-flag icon!** <br>
